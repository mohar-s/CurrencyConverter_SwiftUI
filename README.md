# CurrencyConverter_SwiftUI
Created an internal project for converting currencies

I have created a new project in SwiftUI using the MVVM model.
I have used the ‘ObservableObject’ to listen to the object change value.

Description:
I have taken the list of 7 countries and declared their conversion rate according to the dollar.
Add the functionality to convert any from and to currency assuming a base dollar rate.
